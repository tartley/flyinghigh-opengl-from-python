An exploration of graphics / geometry ideas for a talk about using OpenGL from
Python. Run the demo code using:

    python -O run.py [-f]

-f runs fullscreen.

As always for pyglet / OpenGL programs, the -O flag is important, it can make
things much faster.

Pressing keys adds and removes items from the world. Generally:
    1, 2, 3... simple shapes, then simple composite shapes
    q, w, e... more complex composite shapes
    a, s, d... recursively generated shapes
PageUp, PageDown moves the camera nearer or further from the origin.
Shift PageUp, Shift PageDown modifies the variability of the camera's distance
from the origin (makes it automatically zoom in and out)


DEPENDENCIES
------------

To be able to run the demo, you'll first need:

    Linux or Windows (maybe Macs too, I haven't tried)
    Python 3 (tested with 3.5.0)

    Python dependencies from requirements.txt

Optionally:

    numpy 1.5.0.dev8477 - just used for sierpinski generation.

Back when this project was Python2.7, I couldn't install numpy from source for
Windows. I couldn't succesfully configure distutils to use the mingw32 compiler
instead of Visual Studio. There are not yet numpy binaries published for
Python2.7, so I used an unofficial numpy binary from here:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
I don't know what the state of play is for Python 3 these days.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

I have some simple commands stored in a Makefile, which I run under Linux
or under Windows with Cygwin binaries on the PATH. If you're on Windows but
don't have make or Cygwin, open up the Makefile and examine the targets. The
commands they run are generally dead simple and you can easily figure out how
to do the same thing on your own system.

For profiling, I'm using the standard library cProfile, with 3rd party tool
'RunSnakeRun' to draw the output graphically.

    make profile

will run the script under the profiler, then run RunSnakeRun on the output.

RunSnakeRun is installed using: ``easy_install RunSnakeRun`` (or pip) or
download from:

 * http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun/

RunSnakeRun also needs:

 * SquareMap: ``easy_install SquareMap`` (or pip)
 * wxPython from http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#binaries

Currently runs under Windows at 60fps on my modest 2005-era Thinkpad laptop
(with ATI Radeon X1400). Under Linux on a modest ASUS UX32A it gets hundres
of frames per second.

DESIGN NOTES
------------

(Looking back at this project years later, this is all horrible/shameful.
My apologies.)

The hub of the design is the 'engine.GameLoop' class, which contains the
main game loop and responds to pyglet window events such as update and
draw.

Every item that exists in the 3D space (visible objects, and the
camera) is represented by an instance of the minimal 'engine.GameItem' class.

The engine.World class maintains a collection of these GameItem instances.

The bestiary instantiates a bunch of gameitems, and puts them in a dictionary,
keyed by keyboard symbols. The keyhandler, on recieving a keypress, looks
up the corresponding gameitem and adds it into the world (or removes it if
already there)

The engine.Render class is used by the window draw handler, to render the
contents of the world. If the GameItem has a 'glyph' attribute, then that
object is expected to provide OpenGL arrays suitable for passing to 
glDrawElements.

The code is organised in a 'prefer composition to inheritance' kind of
design. GameItem itself does little more than assign each instance a unique
ID, used as the key in World's collection if GameItems. Instances of GameItem
are then assigned arbitrary attributes at runtime. Generally the value of these
attributes are instances of the classes defined in the 'components'
sub-package, eg. gameitem.glyph is set to an instance of component.Glyph.
GameItems with this attribute are rendered by engine.Render. Those without it
(eg. the camera) are not rendered. There is a tendency for each module in
'engine' to pair up with one module from 'components'. Possibly making these
groupings explicit pairing explicit would be a better way to lay out the files
than the current engine/components split.

Currently, all glyph attribute values are derived directly from the gameitem's
'shape' attribute. The Glyph class does this conversion itself, in response
to an item being added to the world event.

Other components that may be attached to gameitems as attributes include
spinners and movers, that move or reorient their parent gameitem. For
example, the camera gameitem has a 'mover' attribute, which is an instance
of component.WobblyOrbit. This is responsible for the camera movement.
